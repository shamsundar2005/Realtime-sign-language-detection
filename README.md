# Real-time Sign Language Detection

This project develops a real-time sign language detection system using deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures through webcam input. It employs computer vision, machine learning models, and pre-trained classifiers to translate hand gestures into corresponding sign language text or speech in real-time.

### Real-Time Sign Language Recognition

- **Webcam Feed with Gesture Prediction**: The application displays the webcam feed with real-time sign language gesture predictions on the screen.
- **Sign-to-Text Conversion**: Recognized gestures are displayed as text.
- **Sign-to-Speech**: The recognized gestures can be converted to speech based on your setup.

### Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes ASL (American Sign Language) signs via webcam and displays the corresponding word/gesture.
- **Hand Tracking**: Utilizes computer vision techniques (via MediaPipe) to track and locate hands in the video feed.
- **Sign-to-Text**: Converts recognized hand gestures into text output.
- **Deep Learning**: Built on a deep learning model capable of recognizing a wide range of sign language gestures.

### Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- `opencv-python`: For computer vision tasks.
- `mediapipe`: For hand tracking.
- `tensorflow`: For machine learning and model inference.
- `keras`: For managing the neural network models.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech (optional).

You can install all dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow keras numpy pyttsx3
```

### Model Training

To train the model with your own dataset or improve the current model’s performance, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Collect a labeled dataset of images/videos for each sign language gesture.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Use the script to resize, normalize, and augment the dataset.
3. **Train the Model**: Use the `build.py` script to train the deep learning model.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Test the trained model with a validation dataset to evaluate accuracy.
5. **Save the Model**: After training, save the model to a `.h5` file for future use.
